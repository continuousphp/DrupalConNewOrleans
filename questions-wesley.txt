- Why was Drupal chosen initially?
    EC needed a CMS that was open source, a proven good one (white house etc...) and with a large community in order to easily find developers

- How many people are estimated to work on all subsites in total? From all 26 countries?
    between 2 and 3 hundreds developers, around a thousand of "contributor" writing content on the platform on a daily basis.

- How many sites are there now and how many are expected by the end of the year?
    Around 100 sites and counting. more than 100 new sites planned in 2016

- Which are some good websites to showcase?
    http://beta.ec.europa.eu
    https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/
    https://ec.europa.eu/commission/2014-2019_en
    https://europa.eu/youth/splash

- What were the EC goals when they decided to industrialize development?
    For the time being, DG's were building sites on their own with their contractors/hosting/technologies... it provided them lot of flexibility but also lot of overhead, cost, difficulty to maintain and from a user perspective no coherence. In order to rationalize the EC web presence wit a more central team (NextEuropa) it was obvious that we had to automate and industrialize our procedure to cope with the request we recieve from all DG's
